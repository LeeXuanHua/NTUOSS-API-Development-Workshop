Welcome to the two-part TGIFHacks workshop for Semester 2 AY 21/22. This workshop will give you a brief introduction to web-based API development. You will learn the fundamentals behind artificial neural networks and how they help machines to make decisions on their own.

After that, in a hands-on exercise, you will be introduced to Keras, one of the leading Deep Learning frameworks out there. This will open up countless possibilities for you to build exciting and amazing machine learning applications. As part of the workshop, you will learn to train a neural network to identify different types of flowers only with a few given attributes. So let's get started!
