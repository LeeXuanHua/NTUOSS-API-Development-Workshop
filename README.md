Welcome to the two-part TGIFHacks workshop for Semester 2 AY 21/22. This workshop will give you a brief introduction to web-based API development.

## Workshop Details
### Part 1

**Registration**: [NTU Event Registration System](https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe88/owa/REGISTER_NTU.REGISTER?EVENT_ID=OA22020718502714)  
**Time**: Friday, 11 February 2022. 6:30pm - 8:30pm  
**Location**: Zoom (due to COVID-19 measures)  
**Recording**: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/gp994pgurcE)

You will learn the fundamentals behind the types of APIs (Framework, OS, Web-based APIs, etc.), web-based API protocols (SOAP, RESTful, GraphQL, etc.), REST Framework, and HTTP protocols. 

After that, in a hands-on exercise, you will be introduced to the FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. We will together build a minimalistic API that will store (in a database) and retrive the members of NTUOSS. This will open up countless possibilities for you to build exciting and amazing applications with the use of APIs.

### Part 2

**Registration**: [NTU Event Registration System](https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe88/owa/REGISTER_NTU.REGISTER?EVENT_ID=OA22021500473610)  
**Time**: Friday, 18 February 2022. 6:30pm - 8:30pm  
**Location**: Zoom (due to COVID-19 measures)  

You will learn the fundamentals of deploying a REST API on a server running in the
cloud and automating the deployment using CI/CD pipelines. Next, you will be
understanding the various security mechanisms (Basic, Keys, Tokens, etc.) for securing
APIs and dive deep into OAuth2.0. Finally, we will wrap up with another important
concept called CORS when building web APIs.

In a hands-on exercise, you will be introduced to GitHub Actions (CI/CD platform)
and Heroku (Cloud Application Provider) which will be used in conjunction to deploy
the REST API in an automated fashion. Afterwards, in the second hands-on exercise,
you will learn to implement OAuth2.0 with the FastAPI framework in Python.
